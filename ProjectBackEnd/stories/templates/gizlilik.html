Our Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our commitment to combine quality products and services with integrity in dealing with our users and reflects our commitment to your privacy and security.</p>
    <p id="son">By using our web site, you consent to the collection and use of information by Jeunesse as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p id="son">Jeunesse adheres to the privacy principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.</p>
    <p id="son">This privacy policy covers the collection and use of data through the web sites www.jeunesseglobal.com, www.jeunesseglobal2.com (collectively, the “Websites), and the JMobile™ smart phone application, and the [*]™ smart phone application (collectively, the “Smart Phone Apps”). The Websites and Smart Phone Apps are collectively referred to as the “Jeunesse Site”.</p>
    <p id="son">We want your use of the Jeunesse Site and the services we offer to be productive and safe and we have taken great efforts to keep your information confidential and secure at all times within our system.</p>
    <p id="son">If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact Doug Whitehead at privacy@JeunesseHQ.com</p>
    <p id="son">Our Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our site and our products and services.</p>
    <h1 id="ust">Personal Information</h1>
    <p id="son">The Jeunesse Site collects different types of personal identifiable information (PII) such as name, address, email address and phone number.</p>
    <p id="son">When you download and use the Smart Phone Apps, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier. We do not ask for, access or track any location based information from your JMobile at any time while downloading or using JMobile. However, we do ask for, access and track location based information when using the [IA App].</p>
    <p id="son">We send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information.</p>
    <p id="son">In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and services, we may also ask you to voluntarily provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products, and contact preferences.</p>
    <p id="son">Generally, you can visit the Jeunesse Site without entering any PII. However, if you choose to place an order on the Jeunesse Site, we require that you provide your name, mailing address, billing address, email address, phone number, credit card number and its expiration date.</p>
    <p id="son">All of this information is necessary for us to complete the transaction and notify you of your order status.</p>
    <p id="son">For distributors, the purpose of the Jeunesse Site is to manage your distributorship, preferred customers and network of distributors. If you are a distributor, the Jeunesse Site allows you to order products and manage your distributorship.</p>
    <p id="son">In order to use JMobile or the backoffice of the Websites, you must have a Distributor Login provided by Jeunesse.</p>
    <p id="son">When enrolling to become a Jeunesse distributor and thereby obtain access to www.Jeunesseglobal.com and www.JeunesseGlobal2.com, we collect your PII, including your name, home or business address, telephone numbers, email address, IP address, credit card number and expiration date, bank account information (for direct deposit or direct debit), and various government-issued identifying data, including, but not limited to, your passport number, tax identification number, national ID card number, social insurance number, etc. We may also collect scanned copies of government-issued photo ID’s.</p>
    <p id="son">This data is necessary to manage your Jeunesse distributorship for purposes of identifying who you are, placement of your distributorship and of downline distributorships in the tree, compliance management, product ordering, recognition and rewards, and commissions calculations and payment.</p>
    <p id="son">We permit your upline to see only the following PII: your name, the country in which you are registered, your user name, and your sponsor’s name.</p>
    <p id="son">We permit your sponsor to see your name, email address and phone number.</p>
    <p id="son">If you choose to use a replicated website, we will display the PII that you expressly choose: name, Site URL, phone number.</p>
    <p id="son">We also collect third party personal information from customers, including their name, address, telephone number, email address, and credit card number and expiration date.</p>
    <p id="son">This PII is used to charge for product orders and ship product and for no other purposes.</p>
    <h1 id="ust">Non-Personally Identifiable Information Collected Automatically</h1>
    <p id="son">As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, domain type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.</p>
    <p id="son">We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Smart Phone Apps on your device. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the Smart Phone Apps.</p>
    <h1 id="ust">Supplementation of Information</h1>
    <p id="son">In order to protect your account, we may on occasion supplement the personal information you submitted to us with information from third party sources.</p>
    <p id="son">We use services from leaders in the industry to verify your identity, in order to prevent others from defrauding your account or the company.</p>
    <h1 id="ust">Testimonials/Product Reviews</h1>
    <p id="son">If you provide a testimonial or product review on the Jeunesse Site, you should be aware that any personal information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.</p>
    <p id="son">For testimonials, we do obtain the customer's consent prior to posting his or her name and video testimonial.</p>
    <p id="son">If you enter a comment in a public forum we are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these comments.</p>

    <h1 id="ust">How We Use Your Information</h1>
    <p id="son">We may use your email address, mailing address and/or phone number to provide quality customer support or to reach you regarding order status, product or fulfillment issues and other customer service related activities.</p>
    <p id="son">We may use your email address, mailing address and/or phone number to contact you regarding new product offerings, special sales, newsletters, market research, and enforcement of the distributor contract and other aspects of your use of the Jeunesse Sites.</p>
    <p id="son">If, however, you do not wish to receive such communications, you have the ability to "opt-out" at any time and you will not be contacted further, unless you place a product order. In that case, we will send you an order confirmation.    </p>
    <p id="son">From time to time, we may ask you to answer surveys regarding current or future Jeunesse products, as well as to determine hours worked at each rank in the compensation plan. Participation in these surveys is always optional. Survey responses are only used in the aggregate, and are never linked to an individual.</p>
    <p id="son">We may occasionally share the aggregate survey data with our affiliates and development partners in order to facilitate new product development and improve customer service and overall customer satisfaction.</p>
    <h1 id="ust">Information Sharing and Choice</h1>
    <p id="son">Jeunesse is not an "information broker”</p>
    <p id="son">We do not engage in the selling of the profile, contact, web usage habits, behavior, buying patterns, or demographic information of our customers, partners or users.</p>
    <p id="son">We use the information we collect about you to process orders, pay commissions and provide the best and most personalized service possible.</p>
    <p id="son">We will not use or share the PII provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first letting you know and offering you a choice. We will also provide you the opportunity to let us know if you do not wish to receive unsolicited direct marketing materials from us and we will do everything we can to honor such requests.</p>
    <h1 id="ust">Agents/Service Providers</h1>
    <p id="son">We use third parties such as a shipping company to fulfill orders and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services.</p>
    <p id="son">We use Live Chat to assist you if you have questions while using our site or regarding your order.</p>
    <p id="son">When you purchase a product and use our site, we will share your name, address, telephone number, and email address as necessary for the third party to provide that service.</p>
    <p id="son">These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for promotional purposes or any other purpose aside from what is necessary to provide services to us.</p>
    <h1 id="ust">Business Transition</h1>
    <p id="son">In the event Jeunesse goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal information will likely be among the assets transferred.</p>
    <p id="son">You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p>
    <h1 id="ust">Legal Disclaimer</h1>
    <p id="son">In addition to the circumstances described above, Jeunesse may disclose or release information when we, in good faith, believe that doing so is reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with the law, judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site; (ii) to enforce or apply the terms of User Agreement; or (iii) to protect the rights, property or safety of Jeunesse Sites, our users, or others.</p>
